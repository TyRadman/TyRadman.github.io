                <p class="Introduction-text">
                    Hello there, Adventurer! <br/> My name is Ty, and I'm deeply passionate about game design and
                    development. A self-taught developer,
                    I’ve been honing my skills for nearly four years, with several games in development, including an
                    upcoming roguelike title.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After completing my Information Technology degree in 2021, I began pursuing a Master of Digital
                    Media.
                    I have experience as a graphic designer and was involved in a YouTube channel where we shared
                    tutorials on remaking classic games with modern visuals and mechanics, though this project is
                    currently on hold due to my studies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I primarily use Unity for my projects and am expanding my skills into Unreal Engine to refine my
                    C++.
                    I look forward to your feedback and hope you enjoy exploring my work!

                    The Widow is my first personal big project that I started working on part-time in 2020 until the end
                    of
                    2021. The inspiration to work on this project was out of my love for the survival horror genre and
                    was
                    an
                    opportunity for me to learn more about Unity by implementing interconnected game systems that worked
                    together with the player character and the enemy’s AI.

                    I had plans on releasing the game, but realized I’d need more assets than I was able to provide, so
                    I
                    stopped working on it when the game got to full playable state.

                    The Widow is a first-person survival horror game where the player, a detective, investigates the
                    mysterious
                    death of a woman named Ms. Romanov, only to find themselves trapped in the house, and haunted by an
                    unknown

                    </li>

                        to the player’s state. For example, the view gets distorted when the player runs out of stamina,
                        and
                        the
                        camera’s focus changes based on what object the player is looking at.

                        players to think every time they solve them. For instance, the piano puzzle, which is solved by
                        playing
                        a certain combination of keys, has a unique solution in every run, and the solution is embedded
                        in a
                        different note that the player finds before coming across the puzzle.

                    <li class="bulletPoint">
                        <b class="color-widow">Enemy AI</b>: The entity chasing the player uses a finite state machine
                        to look for and hunt down the player. It has a line of sight as well as the ability to hear the
                        player,
                        depending on the player's movements. The slower the player moves, the less likely it is for the

                        and

                        jump-scares might occur in certain areas, with the entity either passing by or staring at the
                        player
                        from a distance before walking away.

                    Meteoric Wars was my first attempt to work on a rogue-like game. The idea was inspired by Sonic
                    Wings (a
                    game I played a lot when I was young) mixed with my love for pixel art and rogue-like games even
                    though the
                    latter wasn’t a part of the plan initially.

                <p class="paragraph-Space panel-paragraph">
                    Meteoric Wars is a vertical scrolling shoot ‘em up rogue-like video game that takes place in a
                    galaxy that’s
                    been taken over by mutated machinery and aliens. The player has to stop the mutation by destroying
                    the black
                    hole generators that cause it.
                    The player can choose from 5 different unique heroes, each equipped with a special ship and unique
                    skills.
                    The enemies are different from run to run in every aspect. So the player has to rely on skill,
                    rather than
                    memory.

                <p class="paragraph-Space panel-paragraph">
                    Here's a list of some the systems implemented for the game that I'd like to highlight:

                        game are
                        procedurally generated except for bosses and the shop (which you can optionally fight.) This
                        feature
                        came to life due to my lack of artistic skills. I wrote a simple algorithm that takes predefined
                        spaceship body parts (body, wings, and tail) randomizes their dimensions, colors and numbers,
                        and mashes
                        it all together to create (mostly) good-looking spaceships that fit the game style.

                        <b class="color-meteoric-wars">Procedural enemy spaceship behaviour and waves generation</b>:
                        On top of randomly setting the spaceship’s visuals, the game also procedurally generates values
                        and sets
                        for their behaviours. Things like shooting, movement, and abilities (for some ships.) These
                        values are
                        saved in CSV files read in Unity.
                        This system takes in a difficulty value from 0 to 1 where zero being the easiest the enemy can
                        be and
                        one being the hardest.
                        The system also controls the stats of the ship like HP, damage, movement speed, etc.
                        Additionally, the waves in which the enemies show up are also procedurally generated. The system
                        ensures
                        the types of enemy ships are varied and well distributed across the waves. It also slowly ramps
                        up the
                        difficulty as the player progresses.

                        better,
                        two players locally on the same device. The game will dynamically increase in difficulty

                        the number of players.

                        only two as
                        I haven’t settled down on the levels yet. The first one is the meteor shower in which meteors of
                        different shapes and sizes randomly fall, destroying everything in their paths, enemies and
                        players
                        alike. The player can shoot and destroy those and can get rewards by destroying bigger ones. The
                        second
                        one is the gravity shift where the camera basically rotates so that players have to continue
                        their
                        fights with new inputs.

                        dropping
                        items that the player can collect. So far, there are only three collectables in the game: coins,
                        experience points, and health packs.
                        The values and the drop rates of these drops are dynamic and situational.
                        For example, stronger enemies drop bigger amounts of these collectables and this is signified by
                        the
                        size of the collectable and the rate at which it pulses. Another example is that health packs
                        have an
                        extremely low likelihood of dropping if the player’s health is full and drop more often when
                        they’re
                        low.

                        The shop shows up in between waves now and then and offers a selection of abilities some of

                    One of the more tedious aspects of Unity development has been managing component references. To
                    address
                    this, I developed the Game Manager Cacher, a tool designed to streamline and optimize how components
                    are
                    accessed and managed within the Unity Editor.
                    This tool organizes all component references into dynamically collapsible sections within the
                    inspector
                    depending on the headers added in the properties declaration, which enhances clarity and ease of
                    use. An
                    editor button does all this (except for project file references.)

                    shared enthusiasm for Battle City, a childhood favorite which we remade in 3D three years ago,

                <p class="paragraph-tanklike panel-paragraph">
                    Tanklike Adventure is a tank game inspired by the classical Battle City where players pilot,
                    upgrade,
                    and
                    customize their
                    tanks to reclaim humanity’s post-apocalyptic world ruled by rogue AI tanks in a procedurally
                    generated

                <p class="paragraph-tanklike panel-paragraph">
                    While Tanklike is still in development, we have successfully implemented many of the core mechanics
                    we
                    envisioned, with a few remaining to be refined through further playtesting. Here are some of the key
                    features and mechanics I have incorporated so far in the project:
                </p>

                <ul class="paragraph-tanklike panel-paragraph">

                    <p><b class="color-tanklike">Tank recoil system</b>: In Tanklike, tanks experience a recoil effect
                        when moving, halting, or firing, akin to real-life vehicles.
                        Initially, we implemented a static recoil animation, which did the job at the time. However, to
                        account
                        for the varied dynamics of different actions,
                        I developed the Tank Recoil System. This system performs dynamic animations by adjusting
                        intensities
                        and
                        motion curves specific to each action.
                        I used Unity’s Scriptable Objects to store and reuse the values passed to the system to make it
                        easy
                        to
                        adjust the values when needed.

                    <p><b class="color-tanklike">Procedural Level Generation</b>: I designed and implemented a
                        procedural
                        level generator that dynamically constructs levels by connecting random rooms from a pool.
                        Tanklike is a room-based game with camera transitions between rooms. This design simplified the
                        complexity of the level generation algorithm, as there were no hallways to connect the rooms.
                        The system places key rooms—the boss room, the player start room, and the shop—within the level
                        layout
                        and ensures they are not directly connected to one another.
                        As for further regions in the level, the player will be forced to look for 3 keys that unlock
                        the
                        boss
                        room throughout the entire level.
                        <br/>P.S. The scale and number of rooms in the screenshot are exaggerated. The actual game has
                        fewer
                        rooms.

                        allows
                        players to play together on the same device.
                        The system was implemented using Unity's new input system. The difficulty of the game
                        dynamically
                        increases in multiplayer mode.

                        the player stops both movement and aim. This adds a little boost to players who have
                        difficulties
                        aiming
                        in the game.

                    <p><b class="color-tanklike">Player Skill Tree</b>: In Tanklike, players can enhance their tanks
                        by
                        upgrading weapons, gaining new abilities, and increasing stats through a skill tree.
                        A key challenge was enabling the UI to be navigable with button inputs for controller users,
                        eliminating
                        the need for cursor control. I addressed this by developing a custom UI element framework.
                        This framework includes a parent component that manages navigation through four directional
                        slots,
                        with
                        each slot having a definable destination. The process of setting these destinations is
                        streamlined
                        with
                        a custom editor script.
                        This navigation setup is applied across all UI components, including the skill tree cells.
                        <br/>
                        I only implemented 5 skills in the skill tree as we haven't fully tested the game's overall
                        progression.
                        It's still far down the project's timeline. But the system's core functionality is working.

                    <p><b class="color-tanklike">Dynamic Camera Controls</b>: Camera control in Tanklike evolved as
                        the
                        project progressed. Initially, we utilized Cinemachine for basic follow mechanics, tracking the
                        player’s
                        movement. However, to better meet gameplay needs, I developed an enhanced camera controller with
                        several
                        key features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The camera follows the player’s cursor instead of the player directly, providing a better
                            feeling
                            when aiming and exploring.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In two-player mode, the camera follows the midpoint between both players' cursors, ensuring
                            both
                            are
                            always in view.

                    <b class="paragraph-tanklike">Mapmaker</b>:
                    I implemented a mapmaker tool that streamlined our room design process.
                    With this tool, we could build the room using tiles, set spawn points for enemies, level props, and
                    destructibles that drop collectables.
                    The visuals of the individual tiles and props change depending on the level.
                    The room is then saved as a scriptable object and can be viewed by the inspector by drawing a
                    simplified
                    version of it using a custom editor script.

                    Cubarun was my gateway to game development. I followed a tutorial made by the amazing Brackeys, and
                    learnt a
                    lot about Unity along the way.
                    After I was done with the simple game introduced in the tutorial, I decided to take it a bit
                    further. I
                    managed to implement a lot of fun systems for the first time in my life.<br/>
                    And that was the beginning of a journey that is still ongoing.

                    Concept
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-cubarun panel-paragraph">
                    Cubarun is an endless runner game where the player controls a cube with special abilities to collect
                    coins
                    and get as far down the cubes world as they can.<br/>
                    The player can collect coins along the way with which they can buy new cubes with new powers to be
                    able
                    to
                    get further into the endless level.<br/>
                    I implemented a lot of systems in this game. And while the project was architectured by undergrad
                    me,
                    I was amazed that the whole thing worked together still without the need to fix any bugs. After all,
                    this
                    project is 4 years old by now.
                </p>

                <ul class="paragraph-cubarun panel-paragraph">
                    <p><b class="color-cubarun">Level Generation</b>: To achieve the endless runner dynamic in Cubarun,
                        I developed a random level generation system that dynamically constructs the game environment as
                        the
                        player progresses.
                        This system operates by monitoring the player's position, adding new tiles ahead of the player
                        and
                        removing old ones from behind to maintain continuous gameplay without loading interruptions.
                        Each tile is selected based on a set of probabilities that determine which tiles are likely to
                        follow.
                        To enhance variety and prevent repetition, the system tracks previously chosen tiles and adjusts
                        their
                        spawn likelihood.
                        As the player advances, the difficulty of the level increases by either increasing the
                        likelihood of
                        spawning more difficult tiles to cross or by increasing the difficulty of a chosen tile. For
                        instance, a
                        tile that has a spinning laser beam will have the laser spin even faster.

                        In addition to the abilities, all cubes have the ability to speed up or slow down, providing
                        crucial
                        gameplay mechanics that players can use tactically to navigate through increasingly difficult

                    Discover the Unseen is a virtual reality (VR) project created for MetroVancouver.
                    The project is designed to offer an interactive, immersive exploration of MetroVancouver's key
                    facilities and infrastructure through a VR experience,
                    utilizing Unity and ArcGIS technologies. This was a 3 months process that included ideation,
                    planning, client meetings, and documentation
                    (which took roughly 7 weeks) before we started the production phase during which I was responsible
                    for the development of the product.

                <p class="panel-paragraph paragraph-vr">
                    The experience starts with a user interface that guides participants into a VR environment,
                    where they can explore a detailed map of MetroVancouver with interactive elements. These elements
                    include pinpoints on a mini-map,
                    allowing users to virtually transport to specific locations. Each location represents a site where a
                    360-degree video of MetroVancouver infrastructure was recorded.
                    These videos appear as orbs, and when a user touches an orb, they are taken to a full 360-degree
                    view of the video.
                    This process can then be repeated with other locations.

                    This project was my first attempt working with both VR as a technology and ArcGIS. It was a fun
                    learning journey during which I learnt a lot about both
                    technologies. I was surprised by how easy Unity makes it to develop VR apps using the 'XR
                    Interaction Toolkit'.
                    I'd like to highlight a couple of systems that I worked on in this project:
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-vr panel-paragraph"><b class="color-vr">ArcGIS Map</b>: One of the client's
                    expectations of my team was integrating ArcGIS into the app.
                    I used the SDK Esri provides for Unity to render the map in VR which was one of the big tasks that
                    slowed down my process as it set a lot of
                    limitations to the Camera and controls in both Game and Edit mode in Unity.
                    I eventually managed to get it to work with both by slightly modifying a script provided by the SDK
                    and drastically changing the hierarchical structure of the project.
                    I also managed to make a little system that allowed users to travel based on real-world coordinates
                    that correspond to the map in the app.

                    A close friend of mine and I decided to remake the game in 3D as a part of our learning journey and
                    love for old-school games.
                    We recreated the entire Battle City game in 3D in Unity in less than a month, using Blender to build
                    our models and textures, and collaborating remotely.
                    Battle City is a multi-directional shooter video game for the Family Computer produced and published
                    in 1985 by Namco for Nintendo family computer (AKA Famicom.)
                    This project is 3D remake of the original game that was done for fun.

                <p class="paragraph-vr panel-paragraph">
                    In my 3D remake of Battle City, I enhanced efficiency by automating level and enemy creation.
                    Instead of manually assembling levels, I developed a script that interprets a 13x13 grid of
                    characters that act as tiles
                    (the size of the map in the original game was 13*13.) Each character represents a specific tile
                    type, like 'w' for water and ‘g’ for grass.
                    The script similarly automates enemy deployment by processing sequences of 20 numbers, each
                    indicating an enemy type, to populate each level.
                    <br/>
                    I added extra features to add more to the experience, such as a camera shake that ranges in strength
                    based on the event,
                    a camera follow feature that takes away the dullness of only seeing the tanks move and
                    post-processing effects to make the environment more interesting.
                    <br/>
                    In addition to that, I was responsible for implementing the player’s movement and interactions,
                    the enemies’ AI that matched the original game’s enemies AI, level generation, local multiplayer,
                    UI, post-processing and some modelling, and the power-ups.
