            The Widow is my first personal big project that I started working on part-time in 2020 until the end of 2021. The inspiration to work on this project was out of my love for the survival horror genre and was an opportunity for me to learn more about Unity by implementing interconnected game systems that worked together with the player character and the enemy’s AI.

            I had plans on releasing the game, but realized I’d need more assets than I was able to provide, so I stopped working on it when the game got to full playable state.

        <p class="panelParagraph">
            The Widow is a first-person survival horror game where the player, a detective, investigates the mysterious death of a woman named Ms. Romanov, only to find themselves trapped in the house, and haunted by an unknown presence.

            "The Widow" was my chance to implement a couple of systems, some of which are:

        <ul class="panelParagraph">
            <li class="bulletPoint ">
                <b class="panelParagraphWidow">Player Interaction System</b>: Allows the player to interact with predetermined interactables, including doors, collectibles, and puzzles.

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="panelParagraphWidow">Camera Effects System</b>: Features dynamic camera effects that respond to the player’s state. For example, the view gets distorted when the player runs out of stamina, and the camera’s focus changes based on what object the player is looking at.
            </li>
            <div class="imagesGrid">

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="panelParagraphWidow">Puzzles</b>: Include puzzles with random solutions that challenge players to think every time they solve them. For instance, the piano puzzle, which is solved by playing a certain combination of keys, has a unique solution in every run, and the solution is embedded in a different note that the player finds before coming across the puzzle.

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="panelParagraphWidow">Dialogue and Tips</b>: A dialogue system adds a narrative to the game, and a tips display system teaches players how to interact with the game.

It has a line of sight as well as the ability to hear the player, depending on the player's movements. The slower the player moves, the less likely it is for the enemy to hear them.
            </li>
            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="panelParagraphWidow">Hide Spots</b>: Some spots can render the player invisible if the entity didn’t see the player hide there.

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="panelParagraphWidow">Audio Management</b>: A system that adds transitions to the music being played in the background depending on the situation.

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="panelParagraphWidow">Inventory System</b>: The player can collect and use items in the inventory. Items range from a flashlight and batteries to keys, energy drinks, puzzle pieces, and more.

        <p class="panelParagraph">
            At first, the Widow project started as my attempt to create a better enemy AI in a horror game than the ones we see in most of games online.

            I wanted the enemy to be able to hear the player from different distances depending on what the player is doing, to be able to see the player from a certain distance, to be triggered by the flashlight no matter how far the player is, to change its routes as it chases the player so that its behaviour is almost completely unpredictable. I was surprised by how easy it was to implement that and how much horror and fun this added to the game (had some challenges on the way but the process was fun.)
