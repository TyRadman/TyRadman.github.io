            The Widow is my first personal big project that I started working on part-time in 2020 until the end of 2021. The inspiration to work on this project was out of my love for the survival horror genre and was an opportunity for me to learn more about Unity by implementing interconnected game systems that worked together with the player character and the enemy’s AI.

            I had plans on releasing the game, but realized I’d need more assets than I was able to provide, so I stopped working on it when the game got to full playable state.

            Meteoric Wars was my first attempt to work on a rogue-like game. The idea was inspired by Sonic Wings (a game I played a lot when I was young) mixed with my love for pixel art and rogue-like games even though the latter wasn’t a part of the plan initially.
        </p>

        <p class="panelSmallTitle smallTitle-space">
            Concept
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            Meteoric Wars is a vertical scrolling shoot ‘em up rogue-like video game that takes place in a galaxy that’s been taken over by mutated machinery and aliens. The player has to stop the mutation by destroying the black hole generators that cause it.
            The player can choose from 5 different unique heroes, each equipped with a special ship and unique skills. 
            The enemies are different from run to run in every aspect. So the player has to rely on skill, rather than memory.

            Game Systems

        <p class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            Here's the list of the systems implemented for the game:

        <ul class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            <li class="bulletPoint ">
                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Procedural spaceships generation</b>: All the enemies in the game are procedurally generated except for bosses and the shop (which you can optionally fight.) This feature came to life due to my lack of artistic skills. I wrote a simple algorithm that takes predefined spaceship body parts (body, wings, and tail) randomizes their dimensions, colors and numbers, and mashes it all together to create (mostly) good-looking spaceships that fit the game style.

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Procedural spaceship behaviour generation</b>: 
                On top of randomly setting the spaceship’s visuals, the game also procedurally generates values and sets for their behaviours. Things like shooting, movement, and abilities (for some ships.) These values are saved in CSV files read in Unity. 
                This system takes in a difficulty value from 0 to 1 where zero being the easiest the enemy can be and one being the hardest.
                The system also controls the stats of the ship like HP, damage, movement speed, etc.

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Procedural waves generation</b>: 
                The waves in which the enemies show up are also procedurally generated. The system ensures the types of enemy ships are varied and well distributed across the waves. It also slowly ramps up the difficulty as the player progresses.

            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Natural hazards</b>: As the player progresses, natural hazards have a likelihood of taking place at any time. I didn’t get the chance to implement a lot of these, only two as I haven’t settled down on the levels yet. The first one is the meteor shower in which meteors of different shapes and sizes randomly fall, destroying everything in their paths, enemies and players alike. The player can shoot and destroy those and can get rewards by destroying bigger ones. The second one is the gravity shift where the camera basically rotates so that players have to continue their fights with new inputs.
            </li>
            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Enemy drops</b>: Upon enemies’ death, they have a chance of dropping items that the player can collect. So far, there are only three collectables in the game: coins, experience points, and health packs.
                The values and the drop rates of these drops are dynamic and situational. 
                For example, stronger enemies drop bigger amounts of these collectables and this is signified by the size of the collectable and the rate at which it pulses. Another example is that health packs have an extremely low likelihood of dropping if the player’s health is full and drop more often when they’re low.
                </li>
            <li class="bulletPoint">
                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Abilities shop</b>: As the players progress, they’ll need to step up their game. The best way to do this is with some abilities which they can purchase from the shop. The shop shows up in between waves now and then and offers a selection of abilities some of which are unique to each player character while others are common and mutual between all (even sometimes enemies.)
                The player can approach the shop, interact with it, and purchase the skills using the coins they collected.
