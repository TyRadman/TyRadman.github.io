                    Hello there, Adventurer! <br/> My name is Ty, and I'm deeply passionate about game design and development. A self-taught developer,
                    I’ve been honing my skills for nearly four years, with several games in development, including an
                    upcoming roguelike title.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After completing my Information Technology degree in 2021, I began pursuing a Master of Digital
                    Media.
                    I have experience as a graphic designer and was involved in a YouTube channel where we shared
                    tutorials on remaking classic games with modern visuals and mechanics, though this project is
                    currently on hold due to my studies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I primarily use Unity for my projects and am expanding my skills into Unreal Engine to refine my
                    C++.
                    I look forward to your feedback and hope you enjoy exploring my work!

            The Widow is my first personal big project that I started working on part-time in 2020 until the end of
            2021. The inspiration to work on this project was out of my love for the survival horror genre and was an
            opportunity for me to learn more about Unity by implementing interconnected game systems that worked
            together with the player character and the enemy’s AI.

            I had plans on releasing the game, but realized I’d need more assets than I was able to provide, so I
            stopped working on it when the game got to full playable state.

            Meteoric Wars was my first attempt to work on a rogue-like game. The idea was inspired by Sonic Wings (a
            game I played a lot when I was young) mixed with my love for pixel art and rogue-like games even though the
            latter wasn’t a part of the plan initially.

            Concept
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            Meteoric Wars is a vertical scrolling shoot ‘em up rogue-like video game that takes place in a galaxy that’s
            been taken over by mutated machinery and aliens. The player has to stop the mutation by destroying the black
            hole generators that cause it.
            The player can choose from 5 different unique heroes, each equipped with a special ship and unique skills.
            The enemies are different from run to run in every aspect. So the player has to rely on skill, rather than
            memory.

                procedurally generated except for bosses and the shop (which you can optionally fight.) This feature
                came to life due to my lack of artistic skills. I wrote a simple algorithm that takes predefined
                spaceship body parts (body, wings, and tail) randomizes their dimensions, colors and numbers, and mashes
                it all together to create (mostly) good-looking spaceships that fit the game style.

                On top of randomly setting the spaceship’s visuals, the game also procedurally generates values and sets
                for their behaviours. Things like shooting, movement, and abilities (for some ships.) These values are
                saved in CSV files read in Unity.
                This system takes in a difficulty value from 0 to 1 where zero being the easiest the enemy can be and
                one being the hardest.
                The system also controls the stats of the ship like HP, damage, movement speed, etc.
                Additionally, the waves in which the enemies show up are also procedurally generated. The system ensures
                the types of enemy ships are varied and well distributed across the waves. It also slowly ramps up the
                difficulty as the player progresses.

                I haven’t settled down on the levels yet. The first one is the meteor shower in which meteors of
                different shapes and sizes randomly fall, destroying everything in their paths, enemies and players
                alike. The player can shoot and destroy those and can get rewards by destroying bigger ones. The second

                The values and the drop rates of these drops are dynamic and situational.
                For example, stronger enemies drop bigger amounts of these collectables and this is signified by the
                size of the collectable and the rate at which it pulses. Another example is that health packs have an
                extremely low likelihood of dropping if the player’s health is full and drop more often when they’re
                low.

        <p class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            I'm a big fan of Unity Editor scripts and I often get carried away during the development time making tools
            that make it enhance the management of the project and its features.
            The following are the tools I want to highlight:

            To streamline testing and debugging,
            I developed a custom Editor Window that facilitates quick access to various classes, assets, and scenes.
            This tool significantly reduced the time required to locate and modify these components. The Game Editor
            tool has definitely accelerated my development workflow.

            One of the more tedious aspects of Unity development has been managing component references. To address
            this, I developed the Game Manager Cacher, a tool designed to streamline and optimize how components are
            accessed and managed within the Unity Editor.
            This tool organizes all component references into dynamically collapsible sections within the inspector
            depending on the headers added in the properties declaration, which enhances clarity and ease of use. An
            editor button does all this (except for project file references.)

            Tanklike is tank game that I've been developing alongside Mohazza, a close friend and collaborator. <br/>Our
            shared enthusiasm for Battle City, a childhood favorite which we remade in 3D three years ago, inspired us
            to take on this new project.
        </p>

            Concept
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-Widow panelParagraph">
            Tanklike Adventure is a tank game inspired by the classical Battle City where players pilot, upgrade, and
            customize their
            tanks to reclaim humanity’s post-apocalyptic world ruled by rogue AI tanks in a procedurally generated
            world.
        </p>

            Game Systems
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-Widow panelParagraph">
            While Tanklike is still in development, we have successfully implemented many of the core mechanics we
            envisioned, with a few remaining to be refined through further playtesting. Here are some of the key
            features and mechanics I have incorporated so far in the project:
        </p>

        <ul class="paragraph-Widow panelParagraph">

            <p><b class="paragraph-color-Widow">Tank recoil system</b>: In Tanklike, tanks experience a recoil effect
                when moving, halting, or firing, akin to real-life vehicles.
                Initially, we implemented a static recoil animation, which did the job at the time. However, to account
                for the varied dynamics of different actions,
                I developed the Tank Recoil System. This system performs dynamic animations by adjusting intensities and
                motion curves specific to each action.
                I used Unity’s Scriptable Objects to store and reuse the values passed to the system to make it easy to
                adjust the values when needed.
            </p>
            <div class="imagesGrid">

                </video>
            </div>

            <p><b class="paragraph-color-Widow">Procedural Level Generation</b>: I designed and implemented a procedural
                level generator that dynamically constructs levels by connecting random rooms from a pool.
                Tanklike is a room-based game with camera transitions between rooms. This design simplified the
                complexity of the level generation algorithm, as there were no hallways to connect the rooms.
                The system places key rooms—the boss room, the player start room, and the shop—within the level layout
                and ensures they are not directly connected to one another.
                As for further regions in the level, the player will be forced to look for 3 keys that unlock the boss
                room throughout the entire level.
                <br/>P.S. The scale and number of rooms in the screenshot are exaggerated. The actual game has fewer
                rooms.

            </div>

            <p><b class="paragraph-color-Widow">Local Multiplayer</b>: Tanklike has a multiplayer option that allows
                players to play together on the same device.
                The system was implemented using Unity's new input system. The difficulty of the game dynamically
                increases in multiplayer mode.

            </div>

            <p><b class="paragraph-color-Widow">Aim-assit</b>: The game has an aim-assist feature that takes place when
                the player stops both movement and aim. This adds a little boost to players who have difficulties aiming

            <p><b class="paragraph-color-Widow">Player Skill Tree</b>: In Tanklike, players can enhance their tanks by
                upgrading weapons, gaining new abilities, and increasing stats through a skill tree.
                A key challenge was enabling the UI to be navigable with button inputs for controller users, eliminating
                the need for cursor control. I addressed this by developing a custom UI element framework.
                This framework includes a parent component that manages navigation through four directional slots, with
                each slot having a definable destination. The process of setting these destinations is streamlined with
                a custom editor script.
                This navigation setup is applied across all UI components, including the skill tree cells.
                <br/>
                I only implemented 5 skills in the skill tree as we haven't fully tested the game's overall progression.
                It's still far down the project's timeline. But the system's core functionality is working.

            <p><b class="paragraph-color-Widow">Dynamic Camera Controls</b>: Camera control in Tanklike evolved as the
                project progressed. Initially, we utilized Cinemachine for basic follow mechanics, tracking the player’s
                movement. However, to better meet gameplay needs, I developed an enhanced camera controller with several
                key features:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The camera follows the player’s cursor instead of the player directly, providing a better feeling
                    when aiming and exploring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In two-player mode, the camera follows the midpoint between both players' cursors, ensuring both are
                    always in view.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The camera’s following speed increases when a player is boosting, keeping the action in frame during
                    high-speed movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The camera zooms out during combat for a broader view and zooms in during safe periods for a more
                    focused exploration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During key events, such as entering a boss room, the camera automatically focuses on the main
                    targets to enhance the dramatic impact.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At all times, the camera keeps the outer boundaries of the room out of view.
                </li>

                any given moment.
                This system determines whether players can shoot, move, use hold-down abilities, super abilities, boost,
                etc., based on their current state in the game.
                Configurable directly in the Unity Inspector, this system allows for easy adjustments and real-time
                application to gameplay scenarios.

                Here, players can purchase special tools that offer a range of abilities, enhancing their tactical
                options. These tools include attack enhancements, healing capabilities, and the ability to summon
                assistant bots, among others.
                Each tool has limited uses, adding a strategic layer to resource management. Additionally, players can
                sell tools they no longer need back to the shop in exchange for coins.

            I implemented a mapmaker tool that streamlined our room design process.
            With this tool, we could build the room using tiles, set spawn points for enemies, level props, and
            destructibles that drop collectables.
            The visuals of the individual tiles and props change depending on the level.
            The room is then saved as a scriptable object and can be viewed by the inspector by drawing a simplified
            version of it using a custom editor script.

            Cubarun was my gateway to game development. I followed a tutorial made by the amazing Brackeys, and learnt a
            lot about Unity along the way.
            After I was done with the simple game introduced in the tutorial, I decided to take it a bit further. I
            managed to implement a lot of fun systems for the first time in my life.<br/>
            And that was the beginning of a journey that is still ongoing.
        </p>

        <p class="panelSmallTitle smallTitle-Widow">
            Concept
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-Widow panelParagraph">
            Cubarun is an endless runner game where the player controls a cube with special abilities to collect coins
            and get as far down the cubes world as they can.<br/>
            The player can collect coins along the way with which they can buy new cubes with new powers to be able to
            get further into the endless level.<br/>
            I implemented a lot of systems in this game. And while the project was architectured by undergrad me,
            I was amazed that the whole thing worked together still without the need to fix any bugs. After all, this
            project is 4 years old by now.
        </p>

        <ul class="paragraph-Widow panelParagraph">
            <p><b class="paragraph-color-Widow">Level Generation</b>: To achieve the endless runner dynamic in Cubarun,
                I developed a random level generation system that dynamically constructs the game environment as the
                player progresses.
                This system operates by monitoring the player's position, adding new tiles ahead of the player and
                removing old ones from behind to maintain continuous gameplay without loading interruptions.
                Each tile is selected based on a set of probabilities that determine which tiles are likely to follow.
                To enhance variety and prevent repetition, the system tracks previously chosen tiles and adjusts their
                spawn likelihood.
                As the player advances, the difficulty of the level increases by either increasing the likelihood of
                spawning more difficult tiles to cross or by increasing the difficulty of a chosen tile. For instance, a
                tile that has a spinning laser beam will have the laser spin even faster.

                cubes,
                each featuring unique abilities.
                This system not only provides a choice of characters but also adds depth to the gameplay through special
                abilities that enhance player strategy.
                In addition to the abilities, all cubes have the ability to speed up or slow down, providing crucial
                gameplay mechanics that players can use tactically to navigate through increasingly difficult levels.
