            Meteoric Wars was my first attempt to work on a rogue-like game. The idea was inspired by Sonic Wings (a game I played a lot when I was young) mixed with my love for pixel art and rogue-like games even though the latter wasn’t a part of the plan initially.

            Concept
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            Meteoric Wars is a vertical scrolling shoot ‘em up rogue-like video game that takes place in a galaxy that’s been taken over by mutated machinery and aliens. The player has to stop the mutation by destroying the black hole generators that cause it.
            The player can choose from 5 different unique heroes, each equipped with a special ship and unique skills. 
            The enemies are different from run to run in every aspect. So the player has to rely on skill, rather than memory.

            Game Systems
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            Here's the list of the systems implemented for the game:
        </p>

        <ul class="paragraph-Space panelParagraph">
            <li class="bulletPoint ">
                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Procedural spaceships generation</b>: All the enemies in the game are procedurally generated except for bosses and the shop (which you can optionally fight.) This feature came to life due to my lack of artistic skills. I wrote a simple algorithm that takes predefined spaceship body parts (body, wings, and tail) randomizes their dimensions, colors and numbers, and mashes it all together to create (mostly) good-looking spaceships that fit the game style.

                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Camera Effects System</b>: Features dynamic camera effects that respond to the player’s state. For example, the view gets distorted when the player runs out of stamina, and the camera’s focus changes based on what object the player is looking at.

                <b class="paragraph-color-Space">Puzzles</b>: Include puzzles with random solutions that challenge players to think every time they solve them. For instance, the piano puzzle, which is solved by playing a certain combination of keys, has a unique solution in every run, and the solution is embedded in a different note that the player finds before coming across the puzzle.
